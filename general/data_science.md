# 数据科学


*An open source DataScience repository to learn and apply for real world problems.*



## Motivation

*This part for dummies who are new on Data Science*

This is shortcut path to start studying on **Data Science** . Just follow steps to understand "What is Data Science and What should study to learn Data Science?"

First of all, Data Science is hottest topic on Computer and Internet farmland nowadays. People created pretty much data from applications and systems until now and time to analyze them. The next steps are producing suggestions from these data and creating predictions about future. You can find [here](http://www.quora.com/Data-Science/What-is-data-science)  biggest question for **Data Science** ever and hundreds of answers from experts. Our favorite data scientist is [Clare Corthell](https://twitter.com/clarecorthell). She is expert of data related systems and hacker, now she has been working on a company as a DataScientist. Clara's [blog](http://datasciencemasters.org/). This web site helps you to understand exact way to study as a professional data scientist.

Secondly, Our favorite programming language is *Python* nowadays for datascience. Because Python - [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) library have fully functionality to collecting data and analyzing. We use [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) to play data and to create applications.
